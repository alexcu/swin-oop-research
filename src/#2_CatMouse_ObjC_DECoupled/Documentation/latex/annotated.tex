\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf C\-M\-Animal} \\*Defines an abstract, base class for a playable `thing' on the screen which can move around etc }{\pageref{interface_c_m_animal}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf C\-M\-Cat} \\*Defines an class for a playable chaser (i.\-e. the chasing cat) }{\pageref{interface_c_m_cat}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf C\-M\-Event} \\*Defines event class of what to pass a view, thereby allowing a link between each view and each model }{\pageref{interface_c_m_event}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf $<$\-C\-M\-Event\-Announcer$>$} \\*An protocol that defines all the methods that each announcer of events must implement }{\pageref{protocol_c_m_event_announcer-p}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf C\-M\-Event\-Manager} \\*Defines Event Manager class which processes each event to each kind of event subscriber }{\pageref{interface_c_m_event_manager}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf $<$\-C\-M\-Event\-Processor$>$} \\*A protocol class that defines all the methods that each processor of events must implement }{\pageref{protocol_c_m_event_processor-p}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf $<$\-C\-M\-Event\-Subscriber$>$} \\*Acts as a parent to subscribers and announcers so that the Event manager knows what to manager (i.\-e. both Announcers and Processors, and this allows this relationship to occur via inheritance) }{\pageref{protocol_c_m_event_subscriber-p}}{}
